# Runtime Overview: Client Pulse Responder

The ecosystem.Ai platform is a powerful tool that allows you to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Use the runtime to deploy your predictors, track their performance, and make predictions in real-time.

## Why do you need a runtime?

The runtime is the core component of the ecosystem.Ai platform. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of your predictors, tracking their performance, and making predictions in real-time. The runtime provides a set of tools and libraries that help you build, deploy, and manage your predictors.

## What is a runtime?

The runtime engine is used to access data, score models, perform other related real-time functions and manage the lifecycle of the predictor. The runtime engine is responsible for processing user input, generating responses, and managing conversations.
