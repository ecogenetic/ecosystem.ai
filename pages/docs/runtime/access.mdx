# Access the API

You can access tour deployed runtime API at the runtime URL. The API is a RESTful API that accepts POST requests. The API is secured with an API key that you will need to include in the header of your request.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ecosystem.ai/invocations \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "campaign": "spending_personality",
        "subcampaign": "openai",
        "channel": "chatgpt",
        "customer": "1234",
        "numberoffers": "1",
        "userid": "openai",
        "params": "{}"
    }'
```

Here is another example payload with a in_param set that can later be used in the model.

```json
{
    "campaign": "spending_personality",
    "subcampaign": "openai",
    "channel": "chatgpt",
    "customer": "1234",
    "numberoffers": "1",
    "userid": "openai",
    "params": "{}",
    "in_param": {
        "airtime_balance": 200,
        "airtime_advance_limit": 30,
        "api_payment_method": "p"
    }
}
```

URL Encoding is required for the in_param field.

```json
{
    "campaign": "justforyou_nb",
    "subcampaign": "justforyou_nb",
    "channel": "app",
    "customer": "1846573d-ac20-45df-a9f0-2fb14da6e7d1",
    "userid": "ecosystem",
    "numberoffers": "3",
    "params": "%22%7B%5C%22airtime_balance%5C%22:%20200,%20%5C%22airtime_advance_limit%5C%22:%2030,%20%5C%22api_payment_method%5C%22:%20%5C%22p%5C%22%7D%22"
}
```
Use the ```/response``` API to send the selected uuid as return for the model to convergen in real-time if it's configured to do so.
