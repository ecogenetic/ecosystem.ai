# Post-Predict

Post-predict plugins are used to postprocess the output of the predictor before it is returned to the client. This allows you to customize the output of the predictor to meet your specific needs and requirements. Post-predict plugins can be used to add new postprocessing algorithms, formatters, and other components to the scoring pipeline.
