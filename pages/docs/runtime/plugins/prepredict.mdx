# Pre-Predict Plugins

Pre-predict plugins are used to preprocess input data before it is passed to the predictor. This allows you to customize the input data to meet your specific needs and requirements. Pre-predict plugins can be used to add new preprocessing algorithms, validators, and other components to the scoring pipeline.
