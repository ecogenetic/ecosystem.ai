# Configuration

Configuration is the process of setting up the ecosystem.Ai platform to work with your data and models. This section provides an overview of the configuration process and the tools you can use to configure the platform.

## Deployment
A project can have a number of deployment actions. Each can have it's own settings and behave independently.

## Settings
If the version number is changed, it will create a new instance for you. In order to use the ```Generate``` and ```Build``` functionality, please contact your enterprise configuration partner.

As project settings are toggled, accordians will appear at the bottom of the screen where additional parameters can be provided.

## Dynamic Recommender Deployment Example

[Deployment](/docs/user_guides/dynamic/deployment) settings can be used to deploy static and dynamic models.
