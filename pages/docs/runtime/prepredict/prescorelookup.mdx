# Pre-Score Lookup Plugin
The Pre-Score Lookup plugin is a template plugin showing how a lookup to a MongoDB collection can be performed in the Pre Scoring Logic and stored in `params` to be used in the remainder of the runtime structure.

<Callout type="tip" title="Note">
    The preferred approach to load data into the ecosystem runtime is using either [Parameters From Data Source](/docs/configuration/deployment/parameters) or [Additional Corpora](/docs/configuration/deployment/parameters). Explicit lookups coded in the Pre or Post Scoring logic should be avoided where possible.

## How does it work?
The Pre-Score Lookup plugin is passed the MongoDB connection. An aggregation pipeline can then be used to return the desired data. The result of the aggregation pipeline is then stored in `params`, making it available for use in the remainder of the runtime process. Data from the contacts and response logging collections can be accessed using the `getContactsLoggingDetails` and `getResponseLoggingDetails` functions respectively.

## Java Code
This Java class named `PreScoreLookup` extends `PreScoreSuper`, which provides functionality that can be used across different pre-scoring plugins. 

Then, there is a static method named `getPrePredict(MongoClient mongoClient, JSONObject params, CqlSession session)`. This function takes three parameters: a `MongoClient` object (which is used to interact with a MongoDB database), a `JSONObject` object `params` (which is used the pass data through the runtime process), and a `CqlSession` object `session` (which provides a session for executing CQL commands on a Cassandra database.)

The `getContactsLoggingDetails` and `getResponseLoggingDetails` functions can be used to access data from the contacts and responses logging collections respectively. These functions take the following arguments
```java
getContactsLoggingDetails(MongoClient mongoClient, JSONObject params, boolean customer_match, boolean predictor_match, boolean unwind_offers, String limit, String offer, String start_date)
```
- `mongoClient` is the mongo connection passed to `getPrePredict`
- `params` is the params object used to pass information through the runtime process
- `customer_match` is a boolean indicating whether the logs should be matched to the current customer number
- `predictor_match` is a boolean indicating whether the logs should be matched to the current predictor
- `unwind_offers` is a boolean indicating whether the offers object returned from the logs should be unwound before returning the results
- `limit` set the number of items to be returned, use an empty string to set no limit
- `start_date` is the date and time before which the logs should not be matched, use an empty string to set no start date
The full `PreScoreLookup` class is shown below:
```java
package com.ecosystem.plugin.customer;

import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
import org.json.JSONArray;
import org.json.JSONObject;

import java.io.IOException;

/**
 * Perform a mongo lookup and store the results in params for subsequent usage
 */
public class PreScoreLookup extends PreScoreSuper {

    public PreScoreLookup() throws Exception {

    }

    /**
     * Pre-pre predict
     */
    public void getPrePredict() {
    }

    /**
     * getPrePredict
     * @param mongoClient The mongo connection
     * @param params The params object used to pass data through the runtime process
     * @param session The cassandra connection
     * @return params
     */
    public static JSONObject getPrePredict(MongoClient mongoClient, JSONObject params, CqlSession session) throws IOException {
        try {
            /* Get the data from the logs */
            JSONArray resultArrayContacts = getContactsLoggingDetails(mongoClient, params, true, true, false, "100", "", "");
            JSONArray resultArrayResponses = getResponseLoggingDetails(mongoClient, params, true, true, true, "100", "", "");

            /* Write the results to params to be passed through the runtime */
            JSONObject loggingDetails = new JSONObject();
            loggingDetails.put("resultArrayContacts", resultArrayContacts);
            loggingDetails.put("resultArrayResponses", resultArrayResponses);
            params.put("prescore_data_lookup",loggingDetails);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.error("PreScoreLookup:E001:UUID: Lookup failed, prescore data lookup not written to params." + e.getMessage());
        }
        return params;
    }

}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Note">
    The name of the class used must include either `PreScoreLookup` or `PreScoreDynamic` in order for `mongoClient` to be passed to the prescore. For versions prior to `0.9.4.3` for `PreScoreDynamic` and `0.9.6.0` for `PreScoreLookup` a mongo connection will need to be opened manually.
