# Pre-Score Basic Plugin

The Pre-Score Basic plugin is a plugin that is used to format the input of the predictor before it is returned to the client. The Pre-Score Basic plugin is a simple plugin that is designed to be used in conjunction with other pre-predict plugins to customize the input of the predictor.

## How does it work?

## Java Code

This Java code represents a class named `PrePredictCustomer` residing in the package `com.ecosystem.plugin.customer`.

This class imports several libraries:
- `com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession` which is a Java driver from the Apache Cassandra database.
- `org.json.JSONObject` used to work with JSON objects.
- `java.util.List` used to work with lists.

The class contains a default constructor `PrePredictCustomer()` and two methods.

The first method `getPrePredict()` has no parameters and returns no value. According to the comments above the method, it's related to a pre-preprocess before certain operations and after the feature store is read. However, there is no implementation of this method in the code snippet you provided.

The second method, `getPrePredict(JSONObject params, CqlSession session)`, is a static method that takes two parameters: a JSONObject `params` and a `CqlSession` session. The method return the same JSONObject `params` it receives and there is a comment indicating that this method is used to manipulate the params that will be used by scoring and post-scoring. Just like the previous method, there is no implementation of this in the code snippet you provided.

The following is an example of the Post Score Basic plugin implemented in Java:

```java
package com.ecosystem.plugin.customer;

import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession;
import org.json.JSONObject;

import java.util.List;

public class PrePredictCustomer {

    public PrePredictCustomer() {
    }

    /**
     * Pre-pre predict, after feature store is read and before dynamic and static corpora.
     */
    public void getPrePredict() {
    }

    /**
     * getPostPredict
     * @param params
     * @param session
     * @return
     */
    public static JSONObject getPrePredict(JSONObject params, CqlSession session) {

        /*
        Manipulate params that will be used by scoring and post-scoring
         */

        return params;
    }

}
```
