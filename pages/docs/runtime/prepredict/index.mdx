# Pre-Predict Plugins

Pre-predict plugins are used to preprocess the input data before it is sent to the predictor. This allows you to customize the input data to meet your specific needs and requirements. Pre-predict plugins can be used to add new preprocessing algorithms, formatters, and other components to the scoring pipeline.

The following default post-predict plugins are available in the ecosystem.Ai platform:
- **[Pre Score Basic](/docs/runtime/prepredict/prescorebasic)** plugin: This plugin is used to format the input of the predictor before it is returned to the client.
- **[Pre Score Dynamic](/docs/runtime/prepredict/prescoredynamic)** plugin: This plugin is used to format the input of the predictor before it is returned to the client and also supports dynamic variables.
