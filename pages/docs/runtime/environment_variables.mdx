# Environment Variables

Environment varaibles are used to manage a number of runtime behaviors which cannot be changed once the runtime is live.

The possible environment variables are:
- **LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT**: The level of logs that the runtime should produce. Valid values are OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. The default value is INFO.
- **NO_MONGODB**: Boolean variable indicating whether the runtime should start it's own MongoDB instance or if an external MongoDB instance will be used.
- **MONITORING_DELAY**: The time period in seconds between updates of the options store when the runtime is configured to use the Ecosystem Rewards Dynamic Interaction algorithm.
- **FEATURE_DELAY**: The time period in seconds between updates of the real time features.
- **PORT**:The port exposed by the runtime.
- **TZ**:The time zone that the runtime uses.
- **ECOSYSTEM_PROP_FILE**:The location of the ecosystem.Ai properties file in the the runtime file structure.
- **CASSANDRA_CONFIG**:The location of the Cassandra config file in the runtime file structure.
- **ECOSYSTEM_XMX**:The amount of memory allocated to the runtime.
