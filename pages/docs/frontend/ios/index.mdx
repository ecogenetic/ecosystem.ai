# iOS App Framework

## Overview

The iOS UI for the Spend Personality module is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ecosystem.Ai platform. It allows users to input their customer number and receive personalized messages based on their spending personality.

## How it Works

Clone the provided repo and follow the instructions below to run the iOS UI for the Spend Personality module. This project is dependent on the [Angular app](/docs/frontend/angular) for the backend visualization services. Start up the Angular app before running the iOS app. Use the settings in the iOS app to point to the Angular app.
