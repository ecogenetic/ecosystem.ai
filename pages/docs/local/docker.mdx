# Local Installation of ecosystem.Ai with Docker

For most scenarios, Docker Compose is the recommended installation method due to its simplicity, ease of use, and reliability.

## Prerequisites

- [`Git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up ecosystem.Ai with the default configuration:

## Step 1. Download the Installation Files

### Manual Download

1. **Go to the Install Option for your Architecture**
 - Project Install Page for x86**: Visit [docker-x86](https://github.com/ecosystemai/ecosystem/tree/main/docker-x86).
 - Project Install Page for ARM64**: Visit [docker-arm](https://github.com/ecosystemai/ecosystem/tree/main/docker-arm).
 - Project Install Page for Windows**: Visit [docker-windows](https://github.com/ecosystemai/ecosystem/tree/main/docker-windows).

2. **Download the ZIP File**: Click the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP."

3. **Extract the ZIP File**: Find the downloaded ZIP file, right-click, and select "Extract All...".

### Using Git

Run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/) command in your terminal, from the desired parent directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecosystemai/ecosystem.git
```

To update to the latest install options and files:
```bash
git pull
```

## Step 2. Install Docker

1. **Download**: Go to [Docker Desktop Download Page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download Docker Desktop.
2. **Install**: Open the installer and follow the instructions.
3. **Run**: Open Docker Desktop to ensure it is running.

**Notes:**
- Docker Desktop is recommended for most users. If you are looking for an advanced docker/container setup, especially for a remote server installation, see our [Ubuntu Docker Deployment Guide](/docs/remote/docker_linux).
- You may need to restart your computer after installation.

## Step 3. Run the App

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

2. **Create and Configure .env File**:
 - Copy the contents of `ecosystem_env.txt` to a new file named `.env`.
 - Fill in any necessary values.
- For an in-depth environment configuration, see the [.env File Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration/dotenv).

**Add your keys** for **OPENAI_API_KEY** and **ECOSYSTEM_API_KEY**.
```
DATA_PATH=./data
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ECOSYSTEM_API_KEY=
```

3. **Start the Application**:
Find your correct install folder. Run the following command from within the install directory:
 - ARM64
 ```bash
 cd ecosystem/docker-arm
 ./start.sh
```

 - x86
 ```bash
 cd ecosystem/docker-x86
 ./start_x86.sh
