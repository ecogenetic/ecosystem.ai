# Workers

### Why do you need a worker architecture?

The worker architecture is a set of tools and libraries that help you build and manage workers. Workers are the core components of the ecosystem.Ai platform. They are responsible for processing user input, generating responses, and managing conversations.

### What is a worker?

There are two types of workers in the ecosystem.Ai platform:
- data workers
- prediction workers
- algorithm workers
