Two main interfaces can be used to access the ecosystem.Ai functionality: 
- The Workbench graphical interface
- Jupyter Notebooks. 

This lesson takes you through the Workbench configuration for Recommenders.

If you would prefer to build your Recommender in a Notebook, head to <u>Dashboard</u> in your Workbench, and click on the <u>Jupyter Notebooks</u> icon. From there, navigate to <u>Documents</u>, <u>Get Started</u>> and find “Get Started Recommenders”.
