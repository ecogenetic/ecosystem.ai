## Predictions is where you deploy, manage, and monitor machine learning models to generate real-time predictions, providing actionable insights and driving data-driven decisions.

The next step is to begin making the models for your project, using all the configurations you have set up in the previous steps.

In the <u>Recommenders</u> section of the Workbench, you will find <u>Predictions</u>. This is where you will manage the models for your recommender. 

***image (store 1)***

You will see a list of all of previously configured models, as well as be able to create new models. Creating models using this interface is more suited to cases which use a small number of models. Cases where tens, or hundreds of models will need to be trained, are better handled in our <u>Jupyter Notebooks</u>.

To create a new model for your recommender project, select **+ Create Model**.

The details you input here will be used to generate a number of models that can be tested and selected for your project.

You will need to provide a unique Predict ID and Description. 

***image (store small 1)

You will refer back to this unique ID at any point in the process. You can also link the model to a previously created project in Allocated to projects.

Specify the Model ID associated with this version of the model, and remember to add the version number to the ID. 

***image (store small 2)***

You will almost always have multiple versions. Assigning a version will ensure you can appropriately track changes, as you experiment with the parameters of your models.

Choose a Model Type from the list of supported model and provide the Model Category.

These details will allow you to more effectively organize your overall model training.

Select the Primary Data Frame .hex file that you created in the <u>Feature Store</u> and update the Version number. 

***image (store small 4)***

Make sure the number in the Version field correlates with the version number in your Model ID.

Specify the Model Parameters and add notes to be stored with the model that describe the purpose, parameters and other actions.

For the Model Parameters functionality: Clicking **Generate Default** will generate a list of the model parameters and their default values. 

***image (store 4)***

These can be modified to change the behaviour of the model. Examples of model parameter set ups can be found in the other pre-configured example projects. 
- NOTE: Further details of all of the Model Parameters functionality can be found in the Prediction Workers documentation. Each worker has its own documentation
    - H2O, PyTorch, Ludwig and Tensorflow.

Notes should include the features you will be using in the model. All of which can be retrieved using **Retrieve Features.**

Notes should also include the model parameters, as well as a summary of the changes made, in each version of the model.

**Save** your model configuration in the top right corner, then begin building out you model and viewing the **Result**, select **Generate Model**. 

***image (store 6)***

This will start the model training, which may take some time to complete. To view training progress, and any interim models being produced, click **Result** to show the models being trained.

Once models have been trained they will appear in the table. 

***image (store 7)***

Selecting a model will show metrics on its effectiveness.

***image (store 8)***

This can be used to select the preferred model, should multiple models be available.

Once a model has been selected save and deploy the model, to have it ready to use in the deployment step. 

***image (store 9)***

You can view all deployed models in the window below your trained models list.
