## Introduction
This lesson outlines the steps you will take to build the configurations needed for your dynamic recommender. 

- Accurately configure settings in the Workbench or Notebook.
- Set up simulations to test hypotheses.
- Follow the guide to then analyze and monitor the in-process results of your live experiments using Dashboards.

Dynamic recommenders should be an integral part of every Data Science job. This capability is designed to allow you to overcome common difficulties associated with the data science process

### Challenges of Implementing Dynamic Recommenders
- Data access challenges include bottlenecks in making data available for modeling and handling cold-start scenarios with insufficient data for new use cases.

- Resource constraints are evident with a shortage of data scientists needed to build numerous models and the complexity of scaling model development across an organization.

- Time dependence challenges arise from the need to manage real-time constraints and latency issues, which affect the timely generation and delivery of recommendations.

### How ecosystem.Ai Addresses These Challenges
- *Streamlined Data Access*
  - Dynamic recommenders streamline data accessibility by integrating real-time data streams, ensuring that the most current data is always available for both modeling and scoring.
  - The capability leverages advanced algorithms to handle cold-start scenarios effectively, using contextual and behavioral data to make initial predictions.

- *Optimized Resource Utilization*
  - Dynamic recommenders automate much of the model-building process, reducing the dependency on a large number of data scientists.
  - The system uses machine learning and AI to rapidly develop and deploy models, ensuring scalability and efficient resource utilization.

- *Effective Time Management*
  - Dynamic recommenders are designed to handle time-dependent contexts by providing real-time data processing and recommendation generation.
  - The platform ensures low-latency responses and considers the temporal aspect of customer interactions to deliver timely and relevant suggestions.

- *Enhancing the Data Science Process*
- The system continuously learns from new data and user interactions, improving the accuracy and relevance of recommendations over time.
- Dynamic recommenders allow for quick experimentation and iteration, enabling data scientists to test and refine models rapidly.
- The platform automates many aspects of the recommendation process, reducing the workload on data scientists and ensuring efficient resource use.
- By considering the temporal context, dynamic recommenders deliver recommendations that are relevant to the user's current situation, enhancing the overall user experience.
