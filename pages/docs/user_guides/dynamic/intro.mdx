Two main interfaces can be used to access the ecosystem.Ai functionality: 
- The Workbench graphical interface
- Jupyter Notebooks. 

This lesson takes you through the Workbench configuration for Dynamic Recommenders.

If you would prefer to build your dynamic recommender in a Notebook, head to <u>Dashboard</u>, and click on the <u>Jupyter Notebooks</u> icon. From there, navigate to <u>Documentation</u>, <u>Get Started</u> and find “Get Started Experiments”.
