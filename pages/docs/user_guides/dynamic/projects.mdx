# Introduction 
The Projects section of the Workbench is where you will make, manage and keep track of all of the work linked to the completion of any particular deployment project.

When you log into the Workbench you will see example projects that have already been created for you in the <u>Dashboard</u> and <u>Projects</u> sections. 
<Callout type="" title=""> 
community edition users will not see example projects

## Managing Projects

![Projects dashboard](/images/recommender/1_Projects/0_projects_dashboard.png)

In <u>Projects</u>, you can either edit one of the existing projects or add a new one. 

![Projects](/images/recommender/1_Projects/1_projects.png)

To view or edit a project, click on the project name. A section will open below the project list with all the project details.

To create a new project, select **+ Add Project**.

A section will open below the project list where you can input the details of your new project. In
Project ID specify a name that everyone in your team can relate to. Add an accurate Description and provide an indication of the Type (eg. Recommender). Specify the Project Purpose. You can also assign dates and individuals to the project. This is more for administrative purposes than a necessity.

The Projects Elements dropdowns are for administrative purposes only.

Adding Files, Feature Stores, Predictors, Deployments and Analysis files here will only add the names of the files, not the files themselves.

#### As you progress with your recommender configurations, you will link items to the project as they are created. Such as the models, frames, simulations and other elements.
