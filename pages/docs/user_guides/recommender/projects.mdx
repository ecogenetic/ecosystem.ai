# Projects in the Workbench
The Projects section of the ecosystem.Ai Workbench is where you will make, manage and keep track of all of the work linked to the completion of any particular deployment project.

When you log into the Workbench you will see example projects that have already been created for you in the <u>Dashboard</u> and <u>Projects</u> sections.
<Callout type="warning" title="Please Note">
If you have chosen a 'clean instance' or have the Community Edition, you will not see example projects.

Follow the steps to *Create* rather than *Edit* in this lesson.

The following projects are pre-configured first examples of various recommenders:

- Simple Recommender
- Offer Recommender Single-Model:
  - shows how offers can be recommended using a single multivariate
- Offer Recommender Multi-Model:
  - uses a collection of binomial models.
-Recommender Experiment:
  - shows how exploration can be incorporated into a recommender environment.
- Message Recommender:
  - show how customer engagement messages can be personalized using a recommendation engine.
- Many more examples are added over time.

Note that the default Recommender functionality will require a [specific data format](/docs/configuration/data/meta) for the Offer Matrix.

You can also assign dates and roles to the project, but this is more for administrative purposes than a necessity.
