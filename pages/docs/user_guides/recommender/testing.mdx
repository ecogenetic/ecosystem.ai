# Introduction 
The Manage APIs section is where you create, test, and manage APIs, ensuring they are robust and ready for integration with other systems. The Simulations section is where you run and analyze simulations to validate the accuracy and performance of machine learning models before deployment.

Once you have pushed your deployment configuration you should do some testing to see if the results align with your expectations. There are two ways to test your deployment:

## 1. Test your API
### View APIs
In the <u>Laboratory</u> section of the Workbench, you will find <u>Manage APIs</u>. Here you will find a list of all your deployments.

If you have been going through this User Guide using one of the pre-configured examples, click on the relevant deployment to view the details.

### Create API
If you have created your own <u>Project</u> and <u>Deployment</u>, click **Create New** to make a new API.

Provide the *Unique Name* of your deployment and click **Next** to add it to the list.

### Configure API Test
Select the configuration to view and edit the details of your API. Go to the <u>Configuration</u> tab and select the one you want to test.

Fill in the relevant details of the campaign, then click on the campaign to bring down the API test window.

Click **Execute** to bring back the API results and ensure your deployment is functioning.

## 2. Build a simulation

Now that you have built, deployed and tested the configuration of your recommender, it is time to watch it in action.

In the <u>Dashboard</u> you will find the worker ecosystem with links to various accompanying elements. 
Click on the Jupyter Notebooks icon to configure the simulation of your recommender deployment. The steps of how to complete this part of the journey is laid out in the Notebooks.

Test your predictions and revert back to any one of the previous steps in order to get the expected outcome. Once your predictions are actively in production, move on the <u>Monitoring</u> step to configure and view your dashboards.
