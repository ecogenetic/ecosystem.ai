# Create and Test Predictions 
The Predictions section of the Workbench is where you deploy, manage, and monitor machine learning models to generate real-time predictions, providing actionable insights and driving data-driven decisions. The next step is to begin making the models for your project, using all the configurations you have set up in the previous steps.

In the <u>Recommenders</u> section of the Workbench, you will find <u>Predictions</u>. This is where you will manage the models for your recommender. 

You will see a list of all of previously configured models, as well as being able to create new models. Creating models using this interface is more suited to cases which use a small number of models. Cases where tens or hundreds of models will need to be trained are better handled in our <u>Jupyter Notebooks</u>.

## Create Models
To create a new model for your recommender project, select **+ Create Model**. 
The details you input here will be used to generate a number of models that can be tested and selected for your project.

You will need to provide a unique *Predict ID* and *Description*. You will refer back to this *Unique ID* at any point in the process. You can also link the model to a previously created project in *Allocated to projects*.

![Model details](/images/recommender/5_Predictions/1_predictions_create.png)

- Specify the *Model ID* associated with this version of the model, and remember to add the version number to the ID. 

- You will almost always have multiple versions. Assigning a *Version* will ensure you can appropriately track changes, as you experiment with the parameters of your models.

- Choose a *Model Type* from the list of supported model and provide the *Model Category*. These details will allow you to more effectively organize your overall model training.

- Select the Primary Data Frame .hex file that you created in the <u>Feature Store</u> and update the Version number. 

<Callout style="warning" title="Please note"> 
Make sure the number in the *Version* field correlates with the version number in your *Model ID*.

## Generate & Specify Model Parameters
In *Model Parameters* you can specify the details and add notes to be stored with the model. Use the *Describe model purpose, parameters and other actions* to take notes.

For the *Model Parameters* functionality, you can click **Generate Default** to generate a list of the model parameters and their default values. 
These can be modified to change the behaviour of the model. Examples of model parameter set ups can be found in the other pre-configured example projects.

<Callout type="note" title="Find documentation for accompanying technologies"> 
Further details of all of the Model Parameters functionality can be found in the Prediction Workers documentation. Each worker has its own documentation:
    - H2O, PyTorch, Ludwig and Tensorflow.  
</Callout>

## Taking Notes & Retrieving Features
Notes should include the features you will be using in the model. All of which can be retrieved using the **Retrieve Features** button.
Notes should also include the model parameters, as well as a summary of the changes made, in each version of the model.

**Save** your model configuration in the top right corner.

## Generate Models
Begin building out your model and view the **Result**, by clicking the **Generate Model** button. This will start the model training process, which may take some time to complete.

To view training progress, and any interim models being produced, continue to click the **Result** button. This will update the list and present the models being trained. Once the models have been trained they will appear in the table.

Clicking on a model will show you the metrics and its effectiveness. This action is how you can select which of the models is the preferred one for your needs.

<Callout type="warning" title="Please note"> 
There may not always be multiple models generated.
</Callout>

## Deploy Models
Once a model has been selected, *Save* and *Deploy Model*, to have it ready to use in the next (deployment) step. 
You can view all deployed models in the window below your trained models list.

You can go through this step as many times as you like in order to acheive your desired results. Be sure to select a model that suits your needs before progressing to deployments.
