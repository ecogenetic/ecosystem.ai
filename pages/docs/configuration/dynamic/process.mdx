## Dynamic Interactions Process

The internal process functions as follows for real-time inference:
- **Invocations API is called**: When api is called, the engine will have the configuration loaded from startup. On first load certain actions are performed to prepare environment. Housekeeping actions are also performed like [creating indexes](/docs/configuration/dynamic/process#indexes).
- **Perform standard options**: All sequence based options that were set in the project deployment will execute for example data lookups, corpora loading.
- **Call Pre-Score Plugin**: Pre-score plugin is called to perform any data or eligibility actions. The ```params``` JSON Object is carried throughout entire execution process and values can be added for later use.
- **Determine algorithm**: Each algorithm has a difference treatment process that depends on the type of data needed.
- **Generate score**: Score is generated based on input parameters or training features. Scores are added to ```params```.
- **Call Post-Score Plugin**: Post-score plugin is called to perform any data or eligibility actions and access to ```params``` allow for full control over all actions.
- **Logging**: Extensive logging of scores and related items, also logging/ecosystemruntime_history is populated by algorithms that do in-line and cyclical updates. This collection can be used to understand changing scores at a fine-grained leval.
- **Payload**: Generate payload to return via API.


## Dynamic Background Process

The background process is controlled by the ```MONITORING_DELAY``` setting as outlined in [Runtime Settings](/docs/configuration/dynamic/runtime). This process functions as follows:
- **Load configs**: Project and Dynamic configurations are loaded on first process cycle, and tested for change every subsequent cycle.
- **Process per algorithm**: Each algorithm has its own process and uses dynamic config settings and update the options store with latest scores.


## Indexes
Also note that this process will create the needed indexes automatically to ensure training and scoring performance.

#### Logging Collection Indexes

1. **`uuid` index**:
```json
{ "uuid" : 1 }
```

2. **`date_log` index**:
```json
{ "date_log" : 1 }
```

3. **`stats.predictor`, `params.value`, `date_log`, and `cache` index**:

```json
{ "stats.predictor" : 1, "params.value" : 1, "date_log" : 1, "cache" : 1 }
```

4. **`predictor`, `params.value`, and `date_log` index**:

```json
{ "predictor" : 1, "params.value" : 1, "date_log" : 1 }
```


#### Response Collection Indexes

1. **`uuid` index**:

```json
{ "uuid" : 1 }
```

2. **`date_log`, `response.offers_accepted.contextual_variable_one`, `response.offers_accepted.contextual_variable_two`, and `response.offers_accepted.offer_name` index**:

```json
{ "date_log" : 1, "response.offers_accepted.contextual_variable_one" : 1, "response.offers_accepted.contextual_variable_two" : 1, "response.offers_accepted.offer_name" : 1 }
```

3. **`predictor`, `date_log`, and `response.offers_accepted.offer_name` index**:

```json
{ "predictor" : 1, "date_log" : 1, "response.offers_accepted.offer_name" : 1 }
```

4. **`response.offers_accepted` index**:

```json
{ "response.offers_accepted" : 1 }
```
