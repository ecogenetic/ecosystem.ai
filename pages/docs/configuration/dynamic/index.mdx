# Intro

Dynamic Interactions are used to implement a class of prediction problem where the rate of change is moderate to high and model convergence is required in very short intervals.

## Key Features

- **Algorithms**: Multiple real-time algorithms are supported.
- **Options Generated**: Options stores are generated from the data.
- **Virtual Variables**: Virtual variables are created for the model.
- **Model Training**: Model training is performed in real-time.
- **Model Deployment**: Model deployment is performed in real-time and updated based on changing requirements.
- **Model Monitoring**: Model monitoring is performed in real-time using dashboards.
