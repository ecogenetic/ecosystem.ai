# Runtime Settings

There are a number of settings that relate to dynamic interactions. Certain algorithms will build models in real-time for example the Bayesian Probabilistic algorithm will train models in real-time if the customer level tracking is turned on.

## Processing Interval
All algorithms have a background process that train models and update the options store. This process is controlled by an environmental variable:
```text
MONITORING_DELAY=120
```
The internal default is 240 seconds if the variable is not set. If you have multiple instances of a use-case running, only set the variable for one instance and disable for all others by setting the time to a very large number.

## Considerations
The background process will interrogate the priors as recorded in the runtime logs and responses. This means that the settings for time window and historical count can have a big impact on your processing time and cost. If you dynamic interactions are slow and infrequent then the settings will not be as impactful as a high-volume engagement environment.
