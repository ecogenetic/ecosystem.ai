## Data Cleaning
- **Zero Fill**: Fill column with zero if empty, use =force for double convert.
- **Fill with Values**: Fill column with value based on search criteria.
- **Flatten Sub Documents**: Specify a key that contains sub document and flatten.
- **Remove Key**: Delete key from all documents.
- **Remove Documents**: Delete documents from this collection based on search.

## NLP Transformations
- **Fragment (NLP) Options**: Tokenize string, stemming, lowercase, uppercase, etc options.
- **Big 5**: Extract personality from text [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).
- **MBTI**: Extract MBTI from text [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Extract named entities from text, add columns with scores [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).
- **Parts of Speech**: Extract parts of speech from text [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).
- **Summarize**: Summarize text [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).
- **Sentiment**: Determine sentiment from text [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).
- **Toxicity**: Score levels of toxicity in text [ecosystem-worker-nlp] (on request).

## Basic Transformations
- **Count Enums**: Count the number of enum categories.
- **Concatenate Features**: Concatenate two columns and create new.
- **Enumeration Builder**: Enumerate attribute and create Enum Collection.
- **Normalize**: Normalize column with new value between low and high.
- **Range to Category**: Use range rules for numeric values and assign category.
- **Aggregate**: Aggregate fields and return count.

## Advanced Transformations
- **Location Extractor**: Extract country and city from string and add coordinates.
- **Prediction**: Execute predictor on selected columns as features and create column.
- **Basket Analysis**: Analyse and present most popular items in basket array.
- **Directed Graph**: Generate a graph from meta definition.
- **Ecogenetic Network**: Calculate core centralities based on network meta-data.
- **Ecosystem Personality Algorithms**: Determine personality from transactional data behavior.
- **Ecosystem Sentimental Equilibrium**: Determine sentimental equilibrium from interaction data.
- **Client Pulse Reliability**: Calculate Client Pulse Reliability scores per grouping of transactions.
- **Standard Industry Codes**: Add descriptions from SIC code.
- **Credit Card Codes**: Add descriptions from MCC code.

## Date and Timeseries Transformations
- **Date Enrich**: Build out day of week, year, month and other features.
- **Featureset**: Generate flattened time-series features by grouping then date and category.
- **Time Series Features**: Generate time-series features by date, then group and category.
- **Forecast**: Forecast next sequence from time-series date and double values.

## Database Operations
- **Foreign Key N:1**: Perform foreign key lookup to another database.collection and return fields.
- **Foreign Key 1:N**: Perform foreign key lookup, aggregate fields and return count etc.
- **Rename Key**: Rename all keys in selected dataset to new value.
- **Indexes**: Create indexes using JSON definition.
- **Cassandra Ingest**: Ingest data from Cassandra into local database.

## Date Enrichment

Enrich data with date related features for example day of week, month, year etc.
