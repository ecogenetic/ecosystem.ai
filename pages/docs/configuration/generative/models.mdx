# Generative Models

Generative models are a class of models that generate data. They are used in a variety of applications, including image generation, text generation, and data augmentation. Generative models are typically trained on a large dataset and learn to generate new data that is similar to the training data. This page provides an overview of generative models and how they can be used in ecosystem.Ai.
