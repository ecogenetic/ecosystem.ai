# Vector Stores

Vector stores are a type of data store that is optimized for storing and querying vectors. They are commonly used in machine learning applications to store embeddings, feature vectors, and other types of vector data. Vector stores are designed to efficiently store and query high-dimensional vectors, making them ideal for use cases such as similarity search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.
