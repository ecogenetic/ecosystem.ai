# Configuration

ecosystem.Ai is a meta-data driven worker architecture prediction platform. Base configurations are all stored in ecosystem_meta database across many collections.

There are many ways to configure ecosystem.Ai, including:
- Workbench configuration
- Runtime plugins in Java
- Python pipelines

The Configuration section of the documentation covers the detail of the configuration options available in the ecosystem.Ai platform. These configurations are largely illustrated using the Workbench, the same configurations can be created using any of the other available interfaces.

For detailed guides on creating configurations for a specific case, see the [User Guides](/docs/user_guides).
