# Endpoints

Endpoints are used to access the scoring API. The API is used to access the scoring engine and return scores for the selected model.

There a a number of endpoints that can be used to access the scoring engine. The scoring engine is used to return scores for the selected model. These can be [customised](/docs/runtime/apiconfiguration) to suit the use-case and the model being used.

[API's](/docs/runtime/access) are used to access the prediction server or any runtime engines in production. The API's are used to access the scoring engine and return scores for the selected model.
