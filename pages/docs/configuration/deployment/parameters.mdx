# Deployment Parameters

The parameters set when configuring the deployment are pushed to the ecosystem.Ai runtime and, together with the [environment variables](/docs/runtime/environment_variables), set the behaviour of the runtime.

## Case Configuration
Case configuration contains the high level details of the deployment:
- **Prediction Case Id**: The name of the prediction case. This is the name for the predictor that will be stored in the logs and, together with the version and project name, uniquely identifies a deployment configuration. When creating a deployment for a Dynamic Interaction configuration this should match the name of the Dynamic Interaction configuration.
- **Description, Type, Purpose**: These fields are used to describe the deployment and the description is pushed to a commented section in the properties file to assist with maintenance.
- **Version**: The version of the configuration. Together with the project name and deployment_id (Prediction Case Id) this uniquely identifies a deployment configuration. 
- **Environment Status**: The environment to which the deployment confioguration should be pushed. Different endpoints and database settings can be configured for different environments.
- **Performance Expectation, Complexity**: These are informational fields used to assist with maintenance.

The types of functionality to be used by the endpoint can be set using the available check boxes which will make the relevant parameters available for configuration.

## Build and Generate Settings
The build and generate settings are used to configure the optional Generate and Build functionality. The Generate functionality is used to create a git branch with the plugin code created for the deployment. The Build functionality is used to build a jar file and image for the deployment.

## Path Settings
The path settings configure the location of the data and models to be used by the runtime.

## Database and Logging Database Settings
The database settings are used to configure the MongoDB instance to be used by the runtime. The logging database settings are used to configure the database and collections in which the logs for the runtime should be stored.

## Target Scoring Engine
The endpoints to push the deployment to for the different environments.

## Parameter From Data Source
The configuration for the customer data lookup to be used by the runtime.
- **Data Source**: The type of data srouce to be used for the lookup.
