# Intro

ecosystem.Ai uses a worker architecture to define and run predictions. The base configurations are stored in the `ecosystem_meta` database across many collections.

## Key Features

- **Meta-Data Driven**: All predictor configuration items are managed from the model meta-data.
- **Broad Range of Parameters**: Parameters are model dependent and can be set in the model meta-data.
- **Many Model Types**: Multiple model types are supported, including regression, classification, and clustering.
- **Model Result**: The model result is stored in the `models` database.
- **Easy Testing of Models**: Models can be tested using the `Test Model` option.
- **Deploy**: Models are saved in the `models` database and can be deployed for predictions.
