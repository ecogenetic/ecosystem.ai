# Post Install Setup Guide

## Base Install

The ecosystem.Ai platform contain many different options and capabilities. The base install is the starting point from where you can configure other capabilities. The base installation contains the following components:
- **App Workbench**: The main interface for the ecosystem.Ai platform.
- **Prediction Server**: A server for running predictions.
- **Notebooks**: A Jupyter Notebook environment for running Python code.
- **Grafana**: A data visualization tool for creating dashboards.

### Step 1. Log in to the App Workbench

The default username and password is `admin@ecosystem.ai` and `password`. Please change the password immediately after install.

### Step 2. Log in to Notebooks

You need to create a new user account for the Notebooks. The default username is `admin@ecosystem.ai`. You can assign any password during the registration proces.

### Step 3. Setup key and login to Grafana

The default username and password is `admin@ecosystem.ai` and `password`. Please change the password immediately after install.

to access Grafana, navigate to:
```web
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
OR
```web
http://localhost:3000
```

You need to generate a key in your Workbench in order to connect to the ecosystem.Ai server for viewing your data. In the Workbench navigate to the **Management** menu and click on **Generate API Keys**. Click on the **Create New** button, assign a name and description and time duration for valid validation. Copy the key. You can use this key to connect to the ecosystem.Ai server inside Grafana.

In Grafana navigate to the **Connections** menu and click on **Data Sources**. Click on **ecosystem-server** and scroll down to ```HTTP headers```. Click on ```Reset``` and the field to the left will open up. Type the word ```Bearer ` and then paste your key after the space:
```
Bearer <your key>
```

```Save & Test``` might produce an error, but you can ignore this. You can now create dashboards and panels in Grafana. Navigate to the **Dashboards**.

- **Presto**: A distributed SQL query engine for running queries on large datasets.
- **Superset**: A data visualization tool for creating dashboards.
