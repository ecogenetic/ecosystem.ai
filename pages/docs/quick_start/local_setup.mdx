# Local Setup Guide

This is a condensed version of our [Local Installation Guide](/docs/local/)

## Step 1. Download the Installation Files

### Manual Download

1. **Go to the Install Option for your Architecture**
    - Project Install Page for x86**: Visit [https://github.com/ecosystemai/install_x86.git](https://github.com/ecosystemai/developer).
    - Project Install Page for ARM64**: Visit [https://github.com/ecosystemai/install_arm.git](https://github.com/ecosystemai/developer).

2. **Download the ZIP File**: Click the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP."

3. **Extract the ZIP File**: Find the downloaded ZIP file, right-click, and select "Extract All...".

### Using Git

Run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/) command in your terminal, from the desired parent directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecosystemai/install_x86.git
git clone https://github.com/ecosystemai/install_arm.git
```

## Step 2. Install Docker

1. **Download**: Go to [Docker Desktop Download Page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download Docker Desktop.
2. **Install**: Open the installer and follow the instructions.
3. **Run**: Open Docker Desktop to ensure it is running.

**Notes:**
- Docker Desktop is recommended for most users. If you are looking for an advanced docker/container setup, especially for a remote server installation, see our [Ubuntu Docker Deployment Guide](/docs/remote/docker_linux).
- You may need to restart your computer after installation.

## Step 3. Run the App

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

2. **Create and Configure .env File**:
    - Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    - Fill in any necessary values.
      - For an in-depth environment configuration, see the [.env File Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration/dotenv).

3. **Start the Application**:
   Run the following command from within the install directory:
    - ARM64
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

    - x86
    ```bash
    ./start_x86.sh
    ```

    - Windows
    ```bash
    start.bat
    ```


## Conclusion

**That's it!** You should now have **ecosystem.Ai** running locally on your machine. Enjoy!
