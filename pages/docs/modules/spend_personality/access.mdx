### Access Scores

once scores have been generated from static models or generated from dynamic models, you can access the scores and use them in other data sets. There are pre-defined API's to use.

API's can be used to access scores and use them in various situations. Review a full example of the API parameters [here](/docs/runtime/access).

### API Parameters

When using the API to access scores, you will need to provide the following parameters:

#### Campaign
This is the same name as provided when configuring project deployment settings. For dynamic recommenders ensure that the names are the same.

#### Sub-Campaign
The sub-campaign can be used to differentiate between different models that are used in the same campaign. This is useful when using multiple models in the same campaign.

#### Lookup
If there is a parameter lookup configured, then this is the value that will be used to lookup the model scoring parameters. If there is no lookup configured, then this value will be ignored.

#### Channel
Different channels can be used to access the scores. This is useful when using the same model in different channels.

#### Responses
The number of responses to return. This is useful when using the API to return multiple scores. For data lookup options only one response is returned.

#### The in_param parameter
With the `Score` API Selected, use the following options for in_params.

Model based recommender:
```json
{}
```

Note that this approach will bypass any parameter lookup settings in the project deployment configuration. Model based configurations that require data lookup replacement use:
```json
{
  "input":["model_param1","model_param2"],
  "value":["value to score","value to score"]
}
```

Dynamic recommenders use:
```json
{
  "input":["contextual_variable_one","contextual_variable_two"],
  "value":["",""]
}
```

Tensorflow or PyTorch models:
```json
{
  "input":["text"],
  "value":["Place text here"],
  "type":"dense_1"
}
```

Question and answer approaches with deep learning models:
```json
{
  "input":["text","question"],
  "value":["BBC Japan was a general entertainment Channel. Which operated between December 2004 and April 2006.","When did BBC Japan start broadcasting?"],
  "type":"qa"
}
```
