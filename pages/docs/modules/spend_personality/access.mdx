### Access Scores

once scores have been generated from static models or generated from dynamic models, you can access the scores and use them in other data sets. There are pre-defined API's to use.

API's can be used to access scores and use them in various situations.

{"input":["contextual_variable_one","contextual_variable_two"],"value":["",""]}
```
