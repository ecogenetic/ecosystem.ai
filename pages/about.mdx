# ecosystem.Ai

**Behavioral Predictions**

**ecosystem.Ai** is a low code environment which uses a combination of AI and behavioral science to select the best campaigns, products, messages, and offers for your customers - in real time. Set up effective recommendations in minutes using our default Dynamic Recommenders and use Generative AI to enhance your interactions. Or configure your own AI algorithms, with control over all of the settings that impact how the recommendations are made.

The complexity and variability of humans means that change is inevitable; the ecosystem.Ai model serving platform assists you in delivering on those tight AI project deadlines with a robust platform that can be used to integrate your models into websites, apps, inbound call centers, outbound dialers, etc and access to a full set of API's.

## What is ecosystem.Ai?

We are a team of social, computational, data and technical scientists. Dedicated to making products that always account for the human in the system. With our combination of skills and expertise, we have dedicated ourselves to designing technology that enables you to interact, intervene and engage with the humans in your system. Change is inevitable, and human complexity is difficult to keep up with. We have worked towards making it possible to identify and change with the humans in every system.

## Why ecosystem.Ai?

### Low-Code

The first low-code environment to combine behavioral social science with real-time machine learning.

Make data-driven decisions powered by continuous learning. Letting you innovate, excite, and create richer human experiences through automated predictive interactions.

### Behavioral Science and Real-Time Predictive technology

Behavioral Predictions: Predictive interactions tailored to your customers’ personality and behavioral patterns.
Real-Time Deployments: Build loyalty with push messages, notifications, and feedback in milliseconds.
Low-Code Environment: Rapid implementation of automated processes with little-to-no coding knowledge.

### We’ve enhanced the veracity of generative Ai

A seamless collaboration of real-time machine learning, and generative AI. Implement ecosystem.ai’s methodology to reduce the prevalence of generative ai hallucinations. Utilise access to multiple approaches that enable you to achieve more accurate outputs, sparking creativity and enhancing your recommendations.

### Artificial Intelligence and Computational Social Science
